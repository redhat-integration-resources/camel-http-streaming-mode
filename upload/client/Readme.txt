Introduction
============

This client sends large HTTP data streams to a server to test its ability to handle large data requests.


Prepare the request data
========================

Create a large file by running the following command:

	dd if=/dev/zero of=../data/input bs=4M count=1024

The command above creates a 4 Gigabytes file.
You can change the parameters `bs` and `count` to configure the data size.


Send a request
==============

Use `curl` to send a request:

	curl -v -T ../data/input http://localhost:8080/test

If you're using the Quarkus/SpringBoot proxy, use the proxy port:

	curl -v -T ../data/input http://localhost:9000/test


Clean the data
==============

When you're done, make sure you perform the following actions:
 
1) Delete the large sample data file to clean your filesystem.
2) Delete the output data generated by Camel under the `output` folder.
